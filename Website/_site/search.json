    "text": "Intradata Relationships\nBefore making any assumptions about plants and their effect, its important to consider any other relationships within the data that may also lead to different conclusions. Amongst the weather variables listed in the exploratory data analysis section, there are a few which correlated strongly due to links in what the variables are reflecting and in the data itself.\n\nCorrelation Plot of Variables\n\n\nCode\n## Importing packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\n## Importing Data\ntotal_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/total_merged.csv\") %&gt;% select(-X)\nrownames(total_cleaned) &lt;- NULL\nhistoric_cleaned &lt;- total_cleaned %&gt;% filter(RCP == \"historical\") %&gt;% na.omit()\n\n## specifying the data for correlation and renaming to make text reading easier\ncorr_check &lt;- historic_cleaned[,7:27]\ncolnames(corr_check)[c(7,9,10,11,18:21)] &lt;- c(\"DrySoilDays\",\"DryStress\", \"FrostDays\", \"NonDrySWA\", \"VWC_Winter\",\"VWC_Spring\",\"VWC_Summer\", \"VWC_Fall\")\n\n## Correlation plot with unique aesthetics\ncorr = cor(corr_check)\ncorr_test &lt;- cor.mtest(corr_check, conf.level = .95)\ncorrplot(corr, p.mat = corr_test$p, sig.level = .10, tl.col = 'black', col = COL2('BrBG'), type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: this correlation plot shows cirlces for correlation, darker green for positive and dark brown for negative. Xs represent where there was no statistically significant presence of correlation.\nIn this plot there are a few groups which have strong correlation and some where there is light correlation overall. The foliage values have some week correlation across bare earth, plant litter, and shrubs but nothing overwhelmingly strong outside of the other foliage. Meanwhile the volumetric water content values at the bottom of the graph are strongly correlated with each other. This makes sense as an abudance of rain in one season would relate to the abundance of rain in the others. Outside of this there are a few powerful correlations which I would like to dive in further\n\n\nDry Stress and Summer Termperatures\n\n\nCode\n## filtering out values which skewed the data\nside_graph_1 &lt;- historic_cleaned %&gt;% filter(DrySoilDays_Summer_whole != 0)\n\n## Plotting the relationship, using color to represent a different variable\nggplot(data = side_graph_1, aes(x = DrySoilDays_Summer_whole, y = T_Summer, color = Tmax_Summer)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  xlab(\"Dry Soil Days Summer\") + ylab(\"Temperature Summer\") + \n  labs(title = \"Dry Soil Days by Avg. and Max Summer Temp.\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  guides(color=guide_legend(title=\"Max Temp.

The average and maximum summer temperatures affected the number of days with dry soil which is expected due to the increased heat having an effect on evaporation, a relationship which also can be seen on the correlation chart. The relationship isn’t as clean as with the other variables but the regression line added shows a positive correlation between the two.\nNext to look at an opposite relationship.\n\n\nFrost days and Avg. Winter Temperature\n\n\nCode\n## Just the plot\nggplot(data = historic_cleaned, aes(x = FrostDays_Winter, y = T_Winter, color = T_Winter)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x) +\n  xlab(\"Days\") + ylab(\"Avg. Winter Temperature\") + \n  labs(title = \"Winter Temperature by Number Frost Days\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  scale_color_continuous(high = \"white\",low = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: the dots in this chart represent a location year’s temperature and number of frost days with the line representing the regression slope of the relationship.\nThis is a clearer relationship than the last with a clear relationship between the number of days below 0 degrees celcius and the avarge temperature of the winter that year. This is not surprising as colder temperatures on the average lead to colder days but it is interesting that there is alomst a logarithmic curve to the data despite a linear fit work to approximate the relationship. Now back to a hotter relationship\n\n\nSummer Evaporation and Summer Precipitation\n\n\nCode\n#| message: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n\n## Just the plot again\nggplot(data = historic_cleaned, aes(x = Evap_Summer, y = PPT_Summer, color = PPT_Summer)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, color = \"blue\") +\n  xlab(\"Evaporation Amount in Summer\") + ylab(\"Precipitation in Summer\") + \n  labs(title = \"Evaporation by Precipitation\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  scale_color_continuous(low = \"white\",high = \"grey\") + \n  guides(color = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: the dots in this chart represent a location year’s evaporation and precipitation amount with the line representing the regression slope of the relationship.\nWhile evaporation was mentioned in passing earlier, there is clear evidence that more rain and precipitation in the summer leads to more evaporation. This is a clear and expected as relationship as during the warm summers with more water there is more to evaporate. It is still assuring to see suxh expected relationships in the data.\nWhile there are other individual relationships to investigate, the correlations in weather data are expected and don’t show much of the specifics that the park’s situation would reflect. Thus I’ll be transition from focusing on how the weather affects each other to how the local flora changes the effects of the weather on the soil and earth."

I wish to go further in examining this relationship by grouping the locations and conducting analysis to see which combinations lead to different water retainment and temperature results.\nIn order to do this I will be conducting a K-means clustering algorithm to determine the optimal number of groups as well as the distributions of those groups themselves.\n\nChoosing Number of Clusters\nMy first step involved taking the foliage data and placing it into the sorting algorithm at many different cluster sizes. Next, I took summaries of the clusters internal closeness, or how well clustered the variables are, and compared the amounts for each number of clusters.\n\n\nCode\n#| message: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n\n## setting random seed so all the values are reproducable\nset.seed(25)\n## Selecting important values\nclustering_val &lt;- historic_cleaned[,7:12]\n\n## Normalizing\nfor(i in 1:6){\n  clustering_val[,i] &lt;- (clustering_val[,i] - mean(clustering_val[,i]))/ sd(clustering_val[,i])\n}\n\n## Hyperparameters?\nn_clusters &lt;- 10\nkmeans_test &lt;- numeric(n_clusters)\n\n## Testing a variety of cluster sizes\nfor(i in 1:n_clusters){\n  kmeans_out &lt;- kmeans(clustering_val, centers = i, nstart = 20)\n  kmeans_test[i] &lt;- kmeans_out$tot.withinss\n}\n\n## Within cluster sum of squares\ncluster_df &lt;- tibble(clusters = 1:n_clusters, Closeness = kmeans_test)\n\n## Plotting to find show the best line\nggplot(cluster_df, aes(x = clusters, y = Closeness)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(\n        yintercept = kmeans_test, \n        linetype = 'dashed', \n        col = c(rep('#000000',4),'#FF0000', rep('#000000', 5))\n    ) + \n  my_theme + \n  labs(title = \"Optimal Cluster Test\") + xlab(\"Number of Clusters\") + ylab(\"Within Cluster Sum of Squares\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: An elbow chart highlighting the point where the slope of the decrease in the loss passes 45 degrees, indicating a the begining pf decreasing returns and optimal number of clusters.\nAfter using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, I found that five was the optimal number. I then took a model with that number of clusters and reapplied it to the data in order to use it for analysis. The results showed interesting relationships between the different foliage types.\n\n\nData Table of the Cluster Means\n\n\nCode\n## Importing library\nlibrary(DT)\n\n## making table with centers\nkmeans_out &lt;- kmeans(clustering_val, centers = 5, nstart = 20)\ntable &lt;- kmeans_out$centers %&gt;% as.data.frame()\n\n## De-normalizing them\nfor(i in 7:12){\n  table[,i-6] &lt;-mean(historic_cleaned[,i]) + (table[,i-6] * sd(historic_cleaned[,i]))\n}\n\n## printing data table\ndatatable(table)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: a table of the average value of each foliage type for each cluster\nA few things that immediately jumped out after looking through the table was the one cluster, five, which seems to have been structured around location with ann_herb, the rest of its values overlap with other clusters. Outside of this, Bare earth and Litter have opposite relationships with the clusters with the most bare earth having the least litter and vice versa, showing a dimension by which the clusters found siginificance. Shrubs also had a similar relationship to bare earth although slightly different between clusters five and one. Otherwise, cluster 1 seems to have more foliage covering rather than bare earth, cluster 2 is well rounded, cluster 4 is predominantly bare earth, cluster 3 also but less so, and cluster 5 being middle of the road outside of the Ann herb values. Now lets see how these clusters act between each of the foliage types\n\n\nVisualizing Clusters of Data in Foliage\n\n\nCode\n## Withdrawing cluster values and assigning them\nkmeans_out &lt;- kmeans(clustering_val, centers = 5, nstart = 20)\nhistoric_cleaned$cluster &lt;- kmeans_out$cluster %&gt;% as.factor()\n\n## Values for Pair Plot\npair_data &lt;- historic_cleaned %&gt;% select(c(Ann_Herb, Canopy, Bare, Herb, Litter, Shrub))\n\n## Number of colors\nl &lt;- 6\n\n## Printing it out\npairs(pair_data, pch = 22, bg = hcl.colors(l, \"Temps\")[kmeans_out$cluster], col = hcl.colors(l, \"Temps\")[kmeans_out$cluster])\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: this pair plot shows the behavior of the clusters in relationships between each foliage type\nWe can see orange representing cluster 5’s behavior clearly with non zero values for ann herb but even for the rest of the values there seems to be clear differences in the clusters across all of the values. Lets also approach this geographically and see the distribution of each of the locations by cluster.\n\n\nGeography of Clusters\n\n                   \nCaption: This interactive graph allows you to see the relationship of locations to each other by cluster, the variety in foliage composition, and the foliage composition of each location by clicking on it on the map.\nIn this graph we can see some geographic overlap with instances like the dark blue cluster 1 dot being more in the valley near water with the light blue cluster 4 dot being similarly structured. Outside of that ere are a few green cluster 5 dots but they are not as common as the other types. While the averages were seen in the earlier graph, getting a georgaphic understanding will help us understand the trends in the next few graphs."

Showing again the trends that we saw with the goliage\n\n\nVolumetric water content by Cluster\n\n\nCode\n## The processing for this data took too long so I saved it and sourced it for compiling time improvement\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/vwc_data_historic_cluster.csv\")\ndata$Cluster &lt;- data$Cluster %&gt;% as.character()\n\n## Plotting it out\nggplot(data = data, aes(x = Year, y = value, color = Cluster)) + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Volumetric Water Content by Season and Cluster\") + \n  ylab(\"Median Cubic Meters of Water per Cubic Meter of Soil\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#BCD2EE\",\"#9B7EDE\",\"#832161\", \"#52050A\",\"#76E7CD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This chart shows the seasonal differences in volumetric water content across the different clusters.\nIn returning to this graph, we can see how cluster 1 with an increased amount of foliage resulted in more water retention over all seasons in comparison to the other groups. The outlier in this case is cluster 5 which, with its fewer groups, seems to have a linear relationship. This may be due to the fewer data points or it represents an interesting behavior of ann herbs! Next lets investigate the soil relationship more.\n\n\nDry Soil Days with Clusters\n\n\nCode\n## Slicing data and summarizing\nother_graph1 &lt;- historic_cleaned %&gt;% select(c(year, DrySoilDays_Summer_whole, cluster))\nother_graph1 &lt;- other_graph1 %&gt;% group_by(year, cluster) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(\"DrySoilDays_Summer_whole\"), mean) \n\n## Plotting\nggplot(other_graph1, aes(y = DrySoilDays_Summer_whole,x = year, color = cluster)) + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Dry Soil Days by Year and Cluster\") + \n  ylab(\"Days\") + xlab(\"Year\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") +\n  my_theme + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#BCD2EE\",\"#9B7EDE\",\"#832161\", \"#52050A\",\"#76E7CD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: The graph depicts historic dry soil days in relation to cluster and time.\nOn the flipside of the previous graph, we can see how clusters with more plant matter had fewer dry soil days. On the other side we can check the water availability.\n\n\nSoil Water Availability with Clusters\n\n\nCode\n## Slicing data again\nother_graph1 &lt;- historic_cleaned %&gt;% select(c(year, NonDrySWA_Summer_whole, cluster))\nother_graph1 &lt;- other_graph1 %&gt;% group_by(year, cluster) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(\"NonDrySWA_Summer_whole\"), mean) \n\n## Plotting\nggplot(other_graph1, aes(y = NonDrySWA_Summer_whole,x = year, color = cluster)) + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Soil Water Availability in Summer by Year and Cluster\") + \n  ylab(\"Total Centimetes of water\")+ xlab(\"Year\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#BCD2EE\",\"#9B7EDE\",\"#832161\", \"#52050A\",\"#76E7CD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: The graph depicts soil water availability in relation to cluster and time.\nAgain, despite an overall decrease that we also saw in the previously graphed historic data, clusters with plant matter had more water retention. All of this begs the question of whether the plants are their due to the increased soil retention or if they are actually creating the conditions to increase absorption themselves. While that question is out of the scope of this project, the correlation between the two variables have been proven solidly."

    "text": "Considering the Park’s Foliage\nBefore we get too lost, I’d like to start by examining the points of the park we have data on and the representative foliage. Each of the 113 locations within the park was measured for the percentage of coverage of each of the following variables: bare earth, herbs, plant litter, shrubs, ann herbs, and canopy coverage. The values in the data represent the percentage of each area covered by each of those values with the possibility of overlap in instances of trees covering bare earth or shrubbery or there being litter under plants. These six values give us the best understanding of the terrain in each of those locations across the park and they remain constant over all of the years recorded, giving a baseline about each location which can be built off of.\n\nFoliage by Location\n\n\n                   \nCaption: This interactive graph allows you to see the relationship of locations to each other, the variety in foliage composition, and the foliage composition of each location by clicking on it on the map.\nWhen we dive into the locations themselves and the percentage of each variable on it, bare earth seems to be the most common in the park which isn’t much of a surprise due to the spare foliage of the desert-like terrain. Some locations closer to rivers and streams may also have more tree or shrub coverage due to the abundance of water in otherwise bare terrain. Which raises the question, are there relationships between the foliage types that arise from access to water or other variables.\n\n\nInterFoliage Correlation\n\n\nCode\n## Reading in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) ## for easier manipulation\nlibrary(corrplot) ## specifically for correlation plots\n\n## Reading in data and removing a wayward plot\ntotal_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/total_merged.csv\") %&gt;% select(-X)\nrownames(total_cleaned) &lt;- NULL\n\n## Plot of the shrubbery (Insert monty python joke)\ncorr &lt;- cor(total_cleaned[,7:12]) ## Getting specific values\ncorrplot.mixed(corr, order = 'AOE', upper = \"ellipse\", upper.col = COL2('BrBG'), lower.col = COL2('BrBG'), tl.col = 'black') ## a few accents to personalize it\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This correlation plot shows the approximate shape of the data’s plot with the oval and gives the corresponding correlation coefficient accros the chart.\nThe answer seems to be yes. One would expect for their to be other plants where there are already some and this tends to be the case, with many of the foliage types having positive correlation to each other. Conversely, an increase in bare ground has negative correlation with many of the plants, showing the inverse to be true as well. This positive negative correlation holds true for all relationships other than canopy and ann herb. The highest correlated is the area taken up by shrubs and plant litter and the most negatively correlated is shrub and bare earth; both of these show that the shrub cover is one of the most linked variables, being both foliage and most in opposition to bare earth.\nNow that I’ve set the scene for the different foliage types in the park, I want to transition to talking about weather patterns which act as a measure of the effects of climate change and can be further used to see hyper local effects."

Some of the more recent and earliest climbing and falling slopes can be attributed to the model used to smooth out the yearly differences but, as we will see with the future scenarios, warmer summers and winters are expected in the future. Outside of this, the winter and summer temperature groups seem to follow similar behaviors as the averages indicates the maximum or minimum temperature. While occasionally the minimum winter temperature may seem to be higher than the average, this is an effect of the normalization and is not indicative of the weather trends over the years.\nTemperature is one of the pillars that will make up the weather analysis going forward, but another equally important to this story is precipitation and its relationship with the soil."

Being in a dry and hot environment, precipitation has added importance in the state park. With this in mind, lets examine the precipitation over time.\n\nPrecipitation over Time\n\n\nCode\n## Data preprocessing\nppt_chunk &lt;- total_cleaned %&gt;% filter(RCP == \"historical\")\nppt_chunk &lt;- ppt_chunk[,c(3,18:19)] %&gt;% na.omit()\ncolnames(ppt_chunk) &lt;- c(\"year\", \"Winter\", \"Summer\")\n\n## Taking the average and pivoting for ease of visualization\nppt_chunk &lt;- ppt_chunk %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(\"Winter\",\"Summer\"), mean) \nppt_chunk &lt;- ppt_chunk %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Winter\",\"Summer\"))\n\n## Plotting with overlaying geoms\nggplot(data = ppt_chunk, aes(x = year, y = value, color = name)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = F) + \n  my_theme + \n  xlab(\"Year\") + ylab(\"Sum of Precipitaion in Centimeters\") + \n  labs(title = \"Precipitation by Year and Season\") + \n  guides(color=guide_legend(title=\"Season\")) + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This plot shows the year to year and ordinary least squares approximation of the precipitation in each season over the years.\nRemarkably, the precipitation across winter and summer seems remarkably similar, with winter having slightly less centimeters of rain overall. Additionally, the amount of precipitation in the park seems to have stayed consistent over the years being measured. Climate change can change weather patterns but it does not seem to have effected this variable very much. Following this though, the precipitation rate is connected to two other variables: the volume of underground water reservoirs which is outside the scope of this article and the amount of water trapped in the soil. On the latter point, water is not valuable for plants if it sinks past the soil into a reservoir or river so how its captured in the soil becomes and important question. On this point, we will examine the relative capacity of soil to handle water across seasons and time.\n\n\nSeasonal Volumetric Water Content\n\n\nCode\n## Data preprocessing\nvwc_chunk &lt;- total_cleaned %&gt;% filter(RCP == \"historical\")\nvwc_chunk &lt;- vwc_chunk[,c(24:27)] %&gt;% na.omit()\ncolnames(vwc_chunk) &lt;- c(\"VWC Winter\", \"VWC Spring\", \"VWC Summer\", \"VWC Fall\")\n\n## Pivoting and reordering for visualization\nvwc_chunk &lt;- vwc_chunk %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(\"VWC Winter\", \"VWC Spring\", \"VWC Summer\", \"VWC Fall\"))\nvwc_chunk$name &lt;- vwc_chunk$name %&gt;% factor(labels = c(\"VWC Winter\", \"VWC Spring\", \"VWC Summer\", \"VWC Fall\"))\n\n## Plotting with season appropriate colors\nggplot(data = vwc_chunk, aes(x = name, y = value, fill = name)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Season of Value\")) +\n  my_theme + \n  labs(title = \"Volumetric Water Content by Season\") +\n  xlab(\"Season of Records\") + ylab(\"MedianCubic Meters of Water per Cubic Meter of Soil\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#42687C\", \"#F3A8BC\", \"#FFD700\",\"#9C2706\")) +\n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: The boxplots are comparing the distribution of volumetric water content (VWC) across all years by season with the inner box containing the inner two quantiles and the range around it showing the outer two.\nBased on this data, there are clear differences in the amount of water stored in the soil by season; a few reasons for this could be the temperature differences trapping water, an increased amount of rain in fall or spring, or heat in the summer sapping away water reserves through evaporation. The latter point will be examined with another variable, but for the rest of the relationships it seems that there is the most water in the ground during Spring and Fall with Summer allowing the least amount on average. While this is a slice of the behavior, just showing the seasonal difference, I’d also like to approach these variables across the years available in the data.\n\n\nSeasonal Volumetric Water content 1980-2018\n\n\nCode\n## The data cleaning for this was done separately, saved, and added here to save time\nvwc_chunk &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/vwc_data_historic.csv\")\n\n## Ploting with one overlay to give a general and specific view\nggplot(data = vwc_chunk, aes(x = Year, y = value)) + \n  geom_line(alpha = .5) + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"black\") + \n  my_theme + \n  labs(title = \"Volumetric Water Content by Season\") + ylab(\"MedianCubic Meters of Water per Cubic Meter of Soil\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: this chart shows the seasonal differences in volumetric water content as well as a smoothed graph which approximates the behavior without the seasonal noise.\nWhen spread out temporally, what jumps out at first is the extreme differences between seasons which manifests as visual noise in the line plot. This shows the yearly pattern of the previous graph while giving more information about the general trend. The smoothed line shows another parallel behavior, that of hills and valleys in the volumetric water content over multiple years which implies boom and bust weather cycles. This trend has ended on a low note in 2018 but seemed to have been trending towards a decline over the timescale as a whole. What this graph leaves us is trends over trends which we hope to explore as we go more into the analysis of the data.\nBefore that though, there are a few other variables to explore."

The first of which is the evaporation rate in the summer which we can assume to be one of the driving forces of the lower VMC. Following that is the number of days in summer with dry soil or very low water amount. This gives a compliment to the previous variable, showing the days after which evaporation and other forces have removed all the water. Next is the soil water availability in the summer which indicated a mesh of the two previous values. Lastly is a tangential representation of the number of frost days or days where the temperature was below 1 degree Celsius. It could be assumed on these days that the water in the ground would be frozen and thus retained.\nDespite the overall upward or downward trends in the graphs, there seems to be a bump around 1998 where there seemed be more rain but also more heat which lead to more water availability in general but also more days with dry soil. These warm years are reflected in the frost day graph which showed a decrease in amount during that time. Outside of that, the trends show less water availability and thus evaporation along with fewer frost days. These trends thus indicate warming effects in the region and the effect of this on water retention in the area."

Lets see what the scenarios do with the seasonal volumetric water content graph we’ve been using.\n\nScenario Spaghetti (VWC)\n\n\nCode\n## Importing libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n## Color palette for scenarios\nmycolors &lt;- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(11, \"RdBu\"))(40)\nmycolors &lt;- rev(mycolors)\n\n## reading in necesary data, it took to long to process\nvwc_chunk &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/vwc_data_nearterm_scenario.csv\")\n\n## Plotting with interactivity\nplot &lt;- ggplot(data = vwc_chunk, aes(x = Year, y = value, color = Scenario)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Volumetric Water Content by Season and Scenario\") +\n  ylab(\"Median Cubic Meters of Water per Cubic Meter of Soil\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  scale_color_manual(values = mycolors)\n\nggplotly(plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This graph shows different scenario expectations for seasonal volumetric water content. Specific scenarios can be chose with the slider on the right.\nNow, this looks like a mess, with so many scenarios it becomes hard to pick out any specific process although in this case each scenario can be clicked and engaged with. However, in each case the scenario number represents when global emissions would peak and how that would effect the variables. While interesting on a micro level, its hard to compare each and every scenario to each other and thus the overall differences are hard to note outside of color. In order to alleviate this problem in this section we will be looking at the groups of scenarios or the RCPs.\n\n\nScenarios by Representative Concentration Pathways\n\n\nCode\n## Importing overall data\ntotal_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"../Data/total_merged.csv\") %&gt;% select(-X)\nrownames(total_cleaned) &lt;- NULL\n\n## Refining the information i'm interested in\nnearterm_cleaned &lt;- total_cleaned %&gt;% filter(RCP != \"historical\")\nRCP_Scenario &lt;- nearterm_cleaned %&gt;% select(c(RCP,scenario)) %&gt;% unique()\n\n## Plotting with interactivity\nplot &lt;- ggplot(RCP_Scenario, aes(x = RCP, fill = scenario)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  labs(title = \"Scenarios in Each RCP\") + \n  ylab(\"Amount of Scenarios\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = mycolors)\n\nggplotly(plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This chart shows the groupings of the scenarios in the RCP groups and can give content to the previous graph.\nAs mentioned before, the scenarios that indicate a peak before 2040 or so are grouped up in the 4.5 RCP while the rest are with RCP 8.5. This is not the limit of the usefulness of the representative climate pathways but it is what we will be using in our analysis. Now lets reappraise the VWC graph with RCP values instead of scenarios.\n\n\nRCP Differences (VWC)\n\n\nCode\n## Reusing dataset and summarizing differently\nvwc_chunk2 &lt;- vwc_chunk\nvwc_chunk2 &lt;- vwc_chunk2 %&gt;% group_by(RCP,Year) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(\"value\"), mean)\nvwc_chunk2$RCP &lt;- vwc_chunk2$RCP %&gt;% as.character()\n\n## Plotting\nggplot(data = vwc_chunk2, aes(x = Year, y = value, color = RCP)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Volumetric Water Content by Season and RCP\") + \n  ylab(\"Median Cubic Meters of Water per Cubic Meter of Soil\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Data from the US Geological Survey\") + \n  my_theme + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\",\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: This plot has the smoothed and seasonal volumetric water content\nIn this instance, their is not a large difference between the two RCP results on the water content, as we’ve established before differences in that value come more from location, but RCP 8.5 could be seen to be a bit more extreme on both angles. As a reminder this is only the estimation of what these values would be from 2018 and are not historic results. Given this RCP framework, lets consider some of the other variables and how they interact with RCP."

The seasonal expectations still align but there are differences between the two on whether there will be an increase or decrease in precipitation. For what its worth, consistency of weather often has more of an effect than its intensity so this may be a sign that the 4.5 RCP will hold on stronger than the other.

Separately, the days with dry soil diverge to start but end with a reversal of the trends, this extreme dip from the 8.5 RCP must here reflect expectations from some of the more extreme scenarios. Once again 4.5 shows more consistency which may be better even if it means more dry days. Soil water availability is almost the opposite of the previous graph, showing a similar relationship with extreme precipitation in 2023 before a dry spell, the extremity of it reflecting the climate variability. Frost days meanwhile show more convergent behavior but indicating that the number of days below -1 Celsius would decrease either way. The increase at the end of the 8.5 value must indicate an expected cold spell which may relate with the results of other data.\nTo summarize these graphs, the 8.5 model predicted a wet period in 2023 before drying out while the 4.5 values stayed more consistent with slight positive and negative trends."

Meteorology is inherently chaotic, it originates the butterfly effect term, but we can also hope for more beneficial outcomes which will space us the future of improper weather patterns foreseen by some of the models. The Natural Bridges State Park and the data sourced by the United States Geological survey acted as a fantastic window for us to view the trends leading to the modern tipping point, leaving the question of which of the scenarios, the more optimistic or less, will end up being the truth in the coming years."
